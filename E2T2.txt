# Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Show the vulnerabilities by resource:

## S3 Buckets cand-c3-free-recipes-... &  cand-c3-private-recipes-...

- s3-default-encryption-kms -> Amazon S3 bucket is not encrypted with AWS KMS key.
- s3-bucket-replication-enabled -> Amazon S3 buckets haven't have cross-region replication enabled.
- s3-bucket-logging-enabled -> Logging is not enabled for the S3 buckets.
- s3-bucket-versioning-enabled -> Versioning is not enabled for the S3 buckets. 
- s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled -> Amazon S3 bucket either doesn't have S3 default encryption enabled or 
  the S3 bucket policy doesn't explicitly denies put-object requests without server side encryption.
- s3-bucket-default-lock-enabled -> S3 Bucket lock is not enabled.
- s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only -> S3 buckets doesn't have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

## Web service instance EC2

- TCP port 20, which is associated with FTP, is reachable from the internet. You can install the Inspector agent on this instance and re-run the assessment to check for any process listening on this port.
- UDP port 23, which is associated with Telnet, is reachable from the internet. You can install the Inspector agent on this instance and re-run the assessment to check for any process listening on this port. 
- UDP port 21, which is associated with FTP, is reachable from the internet. You can install the Inspector agent on this instance and re-run the assessment to check for any process listening on this port. 



# Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

- Restrict Access to Cloud Resources
Use of firewalls to provide the ability to granularly restrict and control network traffic to and from cloud VPCs, subnets and instances

- Use rescurity groups

Security groups used as a second layer to restrict traffic to and from your cloud hosts and instances

- ACLs

Apply ACLs for incoming traffic to all subnets based on trusted networks.

- S3 Bucket Server-Side Encryption
Configures S3 buckets with default encryption enabled. This will automatically encrypt files that are written to S3.


- S3 Block Public Access & Use VPC Endpoints: This allows you to block requests that do not originate from your VPC network.

- Checking Infrastructure as Code for Vulnerabilities
Use regularly tools like Cfripper for the CloudFormation scripts
