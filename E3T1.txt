# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

i-093f8ad663005dcaa is performing SSH brute force attacks against the public ip of the web service instance (54.85.170.221).
Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. 

In particular, VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from Amazon EC2 network interfaces in your VPC. 
Analyzing this information GuardDuty can detect brute force attacks.
