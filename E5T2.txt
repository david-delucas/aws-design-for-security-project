1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 


a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. 


Consider the following open source tools for checking CloudFormation template code:

- Cfripper
- Cloudsploit
- cfn-lint

Consider the following open source tools for checking Terraform template code:

- Chef inspec
- Open policy agent / Regula
- Terrascan

In addition to open source options, many of the major commercial cloud security products offer 
infrastructure as code scanning as part of their product platform including prisma cloud, cloud conformity, fugue, terraform cloud etc.


b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 



Checking container images for vulnerabilities can be done using a number of open source and commercial tools. CURRENTLY AWS DOESN'T PROVIDE NATIVE TOOLS FOR CONTAINER VULNERAVILITY CHECKS
Open source tools include:
- Clair
- Anchore
- Trivy

Commercial products include:
- aquasec,
- sysdig
- twistlock


c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.

- AWS Config 


2. For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.


Network exposure vulnerabilities, as insecure IaC configurations which expand the attack surface
exposing the infrastructure to cyberattacks

Including base images stored in trusted registries allows to detect and address any known vulnerabilities in such base images early.

Unauthorized Privilege Escalations

Untagged resources built using IaC result in ghost resources that can cause challenges in detecting, visualizing, and gaining observability within the actual cloud environment.
