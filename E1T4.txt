# Identifying 2 poor security practices


1. Web Service instance in public subnet.

Security group for application server (WebAppSG) have a very critical configuration issue as it has 
Open All Ports Protocols: it  has all ports open to 0.0.0.0/0 and all protocols open to 0.0.0.0/0
as inbound rules.

This instance is publicly accesible so attackers can reach it an perform DoS attacks for example or other attacks



2. Public access to S3 Bucket "free recipes".

Ensuring that S3 buckets are configured securely is crucial
The vast majority of cloud data breaches in the last few years were of private data being leaked from S3 buckets.


Blocking S3 public access at the bucket-level ensures objects are not accidentally exposed.	
Recommended Action	Enable the S3 public access block on all S3 buckets.

Other recomendations are:

Use VPC Endpoints: This allows you to block requests that do not originate from your VPC network.
Create S3 Bucket Policies: Use policies to restrict and control access.
As it is not mentioned, another recomentation is to Use Object Versioning which makes it difficult for infiltrators to 
corrupt or delete data.
